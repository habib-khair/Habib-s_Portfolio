## 🚲 [Project 1: Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://github.com/habib-khair/Bikeshare_data)

**Project Type**: Data Analysis (Python)  
**Project Completed**: 24/7/2024  
**README Finalized**: 24/8/2024  

### 📌 Description  
In this project, I analyzed bikeshare data for **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. I used Python to clean and analyze the data, providing insights into user travel patterns and station popularity. The program allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week.

**Key Outputs**:
- Most frequent travel times
- Popular start and end stations
- Trip duration statistics
- User demographics

### 📂 Files Used  
- `chicago.csv`  
- `new_york_city.csv`  
- `washington.csv`

### ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy

### 📊 Features  
- **Interactive user input**: Filter data by city, month, and day  
- **Statistics generation**:
  - Travel times, stations, trip durations
  - User types and demographics
- **Raw data viewer**: View 5 rows of raw data at a time  
- **Modular functions**: For better code reusability

## 🚲 [Project 2: Communicate Data Findings](https://github.com/habib-khair/communicate-data-findings)

**Project Type**: Data Wrangling and Visualization (Python)  
**Project Completed**: 24/7/2024  
**README Finalized**: 10/4/2025  

### 📌 Description  
In this project, I analyzed loan data to identify relationships between loan amounts, monthly payments, APRs (Annual Percentage Rates), and loan terms. The analysis provides valuable insights to help both **borrowers** and **lenders** understand key trends in loan management.

**Key Insights**:
- Correlations between loan amounts and monthly payments
- APR trends for larger vs. smaller loans
- Loan term impacts on APR

### 📂 Files Used  
- `loan_data.csv`

### ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn

### 📊 Features  
- **Data Wrangling**: Clean and transform loan data  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Uncover trends and relationships  
- **Data Visualization**: Generate plots to showcase insights  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Monthly payment vs. loan amount
  - Loan term trends and APR impacts
  - Loan amount and APR correlations

### 🧠 Key Insights  
1. **Monthly Payments**: Most common range is **\$100–\$200**, reflecting typical borrower affordability.  
2. **Loan Amount vs. Monthly Payment**: A **positive correlation** between loan amount and monthly payment — larger loans have higher monthly payments.  
3. **APR Trends**: Larger loans tend to have **lower APRs**, indicating a relationship between loan size and borrower creditworthiness.  
4. **Loan Terms**:  
   - **Short-Term Loans (12 months)**: Linked to smaller amounts and higher APRs.  
   - **Long-Term Loans (60 months)**: Associated with larger amounts and lower APRs.
