# 🚲 [Project: Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://github.com/your-username/Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data)

This is a Python-based data analysis project where I explored bikeshare data for three major cities in the United States: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**.  

🗓️ **Project Completed:** 24/7/2024  
📝 **README Finalized:** 24/8/2024

## 📌 Description

In this project, I used Python to analyze bikeshare data. The program allows users to filter data by city, month, and day of the week, and outputs useful statistics such as:
- Most frequent travel times
- Popular start and end stations
- Trip duration statistics
- User demographics

An interactive terminal interface was built to let users explore the data through raw input prompts.

# 🚲 [Second Project: Communicate Data Findings](https://github.com/your-username/Communicate-Data-Findings)

This is a **data wrangling** and **visualization** project where I analyzed loan data to uncover key trends in loan amounts, monthly payments, APRs, and loan terms.  

🗓️ **Project Completed:** 24/7/2024  
📝 **README Finalized:** 10/4/2025

---

## 📌 Description

In this project, I used Python to clean and analyze loan data. The goal was to uncover insights to help both **borrowers** and **lenders** understand key relationships in the data, such as:

- Loan amounts  
- Monthly payments  
- APRs (Annual Percentage Rates)  
- Loan terms

The analysis provides valuable insights into how these factors interact and affect loan decisions.

## 📂 Files Used

- `loan_data.csv`

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📊 Features

- **Data Wrangling**: Cleaning and transforming the loan data for analysis  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Identifying trends and relationships between loan attributes  
- **Data Visualization**: Creating plots to visualize key insights  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Monthly payment ranges and loan amounts
  - Loan term trends and their impact on APR
  - Correlations between loan amounts and APRs

---

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 1. **Monthly Payments**
- The most common monthly payment range is **\$100–\$200**, indicating typical borrower affordability.

### 2. **Loan Amount vs. Monthly Payment**
- There is a **positive correlation** between loan amounts and monthly payments — larger loans result in higher monthly payments.

### 3. **APR Trends**
- Borrowers with **larger loan amounts** tend to receive **lower APRs**, likely due to stronger credit profiles.

### 4. **Loan Terms**
- **Short-Term Loans (12 months)**:
  - Associated with **smaller loan amounts** and **higher APRs**.
  
- **Long-Term Loans (60 months)**:
  - Linked to **larger loan amounts** and **lower APRs**.

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This analysis shows how loan amounts, monthly payments, and APRs are interrelated:

- Larger loans lead to **higher monthly payments**, but typically come with **lower APRs**.
- **Short-term loans** are often **smaller and more expensive** due to higher interest rates.
- **Long-term loans** tend to be **larger with more favorable interest rates**.

These insights can be beneficial for both lenders and borrowers when making financial decisions regarding loan terms, payments, and APR.
